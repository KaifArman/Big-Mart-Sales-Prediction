# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
Sales Prediction Model for Big Mart Outlets

## Project Overview

**Aim of the Project:** 
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates sales for each product across different Big Mart stores. With accurate demand forecasting at the store level, Big Mart outlets can optimize their inventory management to better meet customer demand.

**Tools and Techniques Used:**  
This project leverages Python and key data science libraries:
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas for data cleaning and preparation.
- **Modeling:** Scikit-Learn and XGBoost for building and tuning machine learning models.
- **Deployment:** Tkinter for creating a user-friendly interface and Joblib for model persistence.

**Project Outcome:**  
The model performs well in predicting sales, offering Big Mart valuable insights into demand patterns that can streamline retail operations and improve stock management.

**User Interface and Deployment:**  
A desktop application built with the Tkinter library allows users to enter product details and obtain sales predictions instantly. This app is designed to be user-friendly and accessible even to non-technical users. With Joblib, the model can be easily saved and loaded, ensuring cross-system compatibility and ease of use.


This project exemplifies how data science can drive practical outcomes, enabling Big Mart to optimize inventory, enhance service quality, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction through precise demand predictions.
